\chapter{Solution Description}
\label{chap:SOLUTION}

The construction of a C style checker will provide a solution to a number of 
the problems identified in the problem description in \autoref{chap:PROBLEM}.
It will provide a method of immediate feedback to the students which will 
optimistically help to reinforce the knowledge of the coding standard.
Additionally by providing the style checker through a web based interface, 
the style checker can provide the additional functionality of presenting the 
student their code directly to the right of their list of errors. The code 
view will additionally provide content which is editable allowing the students 
to make the corrections instantly. Unfortunately the code view lacks any 
interactive web features and provides only the minimal amount of functionality 
to make it a useful asset to students.
