\chapter{Problem Description}
\label{chap:PROBLEM}

In latex we have a great deal of flexibility in creating and naming
sections; for instance, we used ``\verb|\chapter{Sectioning}|''
command to create this section. After the main chapters of your
thesis have been included, you can use the command 
\verb|\appendix| to indicate that all subsequent chapters should 
be called appendices.  For example,

\begin{verbatim}
\chapter{A chapter}
Chapter contents...
\appendix
\chapter{An Appendix}
Appendix Contents...
\end{verbatim}

\noindent will ensure that the chapter titled ``An Appendix''
will be referred to as Appendix~A in the document.  See
Appendix~\ref{chap:websites}, for example.

We can also create many other types of sections, as seen here:

\section{A Sample Section}
\label{sec:ONE}

Sectioning is an important organization tool in your thesis.
In \LaTeX\ and \TeX\ (with ``eplain'') there is built-in support for
sectioning along with appropriate section numbering. 

For example, this section was introduced with 
\verb|\section{A Sample Section}|.

\subsection{A sample SUBSECTION}
\label{sec:TWO}
Subsection text, which was introduced with 
\verb|\subsection{A sample SUBSECTION}|.
\subsubsection{And a SUBSUBSECTION}
\label{sec:THREE}
Note that in the Acadia thesis style, there is no number for a
sub-sub-section.  This is the text of the sub-sub-section, which was
introduced with the somewhat longer command
\verb|\subsubsection{And a SUBSUBSECTION}|.
\paragraph{PARAGRAPH 1}
\label{sec:FOUR}
We can also create paragraphs with paragraph titles.  This was
introduced with \verb|\paragraph{PARAGRAPH 1}|.
\subparagraph{SUBPARAGRAPH Label}
And we can even do a sub-paragraph, which was introduced with
\verb|\subparagraph{SUBPARAGRAPH Label}|. 
\label{sec:FIVE}
Yet more subparagraph text.

\section{Custom Sectioning}
\label{sec:CUSTOMSEC}
You can also create other types of sections like \verb|definition|.
For example, two definitions of baked goods (specifically, cookies)
follow.  Notice that the first one includes the command
\verb|\label{def:COOKIE}| so that the second definition (or other
things in your document) can refer to it by using
\verb|\ref{def:COOKIE}|.  This is \emph{much} better than explicitly
using ``4.1'' in your text; if you revise your document later and add
a new definition before this one, \LaTeX\ will automagically renumber
not only your definitions, but also the references to the definitions.
The careful reader will also notice that instead of carelessly writing
the obvious ``\verb|(Definition \ref{def:COOKIE})|'' we instead took
the extra tiny amount of time to write
``\verb|(Definition~\ref{def:COOKIE})|''.  The ``\verb|~|'' is a
\emph{non-breakable} space; this means that the word ``Definition''
won't appear at the end of one line, leaving ``\ref{def:COOKIE}'' all
by itself at the beginning of the next line.

Our first usage:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{definition}
    \label{def:COOKIE}
    \begin{changemargin}{1cm}{0cm}      
        A \emph{cookie} is a round baked good that is tasty,
        sugary, and usually bad for you. See~\citep{COOKIE}.
    \end{changemargin}
\end{definition}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent creates the example:

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:COOKIE}
    \begin{changemargin}{1cm}{0cm}      
    A \emph{cookie} is a round baked good that is tasty,
    sugary, and usually bad for you. See~\citep{COOKIE}.
    \end{changemargin}
\end{definition}

\noindent and the code:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{definition}
    \label{def:PBCOOKIE}
    \begin{changemargin}{1cm}{0cm}      
        A \emph{peanut butter cookie} is a \emph{cookie}
        (Definition~\ref{def:COOKIE}) which contains, at a minimum,
        the ingredients peanut butter, flour, sugar and eggs.  Peanut
        Butter cookies are said to be \emph{delicious}.
    \end{changemargin}
\end{definition}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent creates:

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:PBCOOKIE}
    \begin{changemargin}{1cm}{0cm}      
        A \emph{peanut butter cookie} is a \emph{cookie}
        (Definition~\ref{def:COOKIE}) which contains, at a minimum,
        the ingredients peanut butter, flour, sugar and eggs.  Peanut
        Butter cookies are said to be \emph{delicious}.
    \end{changemargin}
\end{definition}

To create the custom ``Definition'' section we included the 
following code in \verb|HEADER.tex|:

\begin{verbatim}
        \theoremstyle{definition}
        \newtheorem{definition}{Definition}[chapter]
\end{verbatim}

Notice in this command \verb|\theoremstyle{definition}|
creates a new style based on a theorem layout (part of 
the AMS package). We then define the ``Definition'' using
this style (the first argument). The second argument 
\verb|{Definition}| defines the label of the ``Definition''
within the text, and the third argument \verb|[chapter]| ties
the number of a ``Definition'' to that of a chapter; thus
``Definition'' sections will be numbered as sub-sections of
Chapters in the document.

To adjust the margins of the definition text, we changed the
indenting within the definition using the custom commands in
\verb|header.tex|:

\begin{verbatim}
    \begin{changemargin}{LEFTMARGIN}{RIGHTMARGIN}       
         Text to be indented goes here...
    \end{changemargin}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Note that the argument \verb|LEFTMARGIN| was set to 
\verb|1cm| and \verb|RIGHTMARGIN| was set to \verb|0cm| in the 
above examples.

\section{Cross-Referencing Sections}
\label{sec:CROSS_REF}

The keen observer will have noticed that we used a cross-reference
when defining what a Peanut Butter cookie was: ``A 
\emph{peanut butter cookie} is a \emph{cookie} 
(Definition~\ref{def:COOKIE})\dots'' this feature is extremely useful
since it allows us to refer to other sections of the document
using section numbering.

Let's say we want to reference our section on sections.
We have defined the section using the command:

\begin{verbatim}
\section{SECTION}
\label{sec:ONE}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent which creates a ``section'' called ``SECTION'' and
associates a label ``\verb|sec:ONE|'' with this section.  Now I can
reference this label from elsewhere in the document.  For example, the
input

\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}
As shown in Section~\ref{sec:ONE}, we can create different\dots
\end{verbatim}
\end{center}

\noindent would produce:

\begin{center}
As shown in Section~\ref{sec:ONE}, we can create different\dots
\end{center}

\noindent in the document.

Finally, the numbering of a cross-reference reflects the numbering
of the actual label in the document.  Therefore, if the document's
number is updated, the cross-reference will also be updated to
suit.  This is \emph{much} easier than trying to maintain
cross-referencing manually.
