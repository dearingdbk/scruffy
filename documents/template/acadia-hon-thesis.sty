NOTE TO ACADIA USERS:
These comments, which were present in the original style file which
from Way Back When, may be of interest if you have to do something
which the template doesn't already give you, but you should really
also look at header.tex and preliminaries.tex.  Notice that the
comments don't all make sense vis-a-vis acadiahonthesis.sty.

Example of use:
    \documentclass{report}

    \usepackage{acadiahonthesis}
    \usepackage{tikz}
    \usepackage{listings}
    \usepackage[toc]{glossaries}

Documentation: 
    This style file modifies the standard report style to follow the
    Graduate Degree Support Section of the Registrar's Office's
    "Directions for Preparing Doctoral Dissertations".  It sets the
    margins and inter-line spacing and disallows page breaks at
    hyphens.

    The \beforepreface command creates the title page, a copyright page
    (optionally), and a signature page.  Then the user should put
    preface section(s), using the \prefacesection{section title}
    command.  The \afterpreface command then produces the tables of
    contents, tables and figures, and sets things up to start
    the main body (on Arabic page 1).
    
    The following commands can control what goes in the front matter
    material:
    
        \title{thesis title}
        \author{author's name}
        \dept{author's department}
                - Computer Science if omitted
The following switches allow for special title pages
        \committeethesis - for a thesis in a committee (no dept.)
                           use \dept{committee name}
        \programthesis - for a thesis in a program (no dept.)
                           use \dept{program name}
        \educationthesis - for the School of Education. \dept doesn't matter
        \specialthesis  - for a Graduate Special thesis
        \industrialthesis - for a thesis in Industrial Engineering
        \dualthesis     - for a thesis in a dual language department.
                          Also define \language{language}.

        \principaladviser{the principal advisor's name}
           (or \principaladvisor, if you prefer advisor spelled with o)
        \coprincipaladviser{optional second principal advisor's name}
           (or \coprincipaladvisor, use only if you have two principal
           advisors only for the second one)
        \firstreader{the first reader's name}
        \secondreader{the second reader's name}
        \thirdreader{optional third reader's name}
        \submitdate{month year in which submitted to GPO}
                - date LaTeX'd if omitted
        \copyrightyear{year degree conferred (next year if submitted
          in Fall quarter)}
                - year LaTeX'd (or next year, in December) if omitted
        \copyrighttrue or \copyrightfalse
                - produce or don't produce a copyright page (true by default)
        \thesiscopyrighttrue or \thesiscopyrightfalse
                - produces the style of copyright page listed by the
                Thesis Office or the style that everyone else uses
                (Thesis office by default).
        \figurespagetrue or \figurespagefalse
                - produce or don't produce a List of Figures page
                  (true by default)
        \tablespagetrue or \tablespagefalse
                - produce or don't produce a List of Tables page
                  (true by default)

This style uses inter-line spacing that is 1.3 times normal, except
in the figure and table environments where normal spacing is used.
That can be changed by doing:
    \renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.6}
(or whatever you want instead of 1.6)
Unfortunately, that command probably won't take effect unless it comes
before the \begin{document} or is followed by something like \small
\normalsize. 

You can also set any particular section in single-spacing mode by using
the singlespace environment.  For example

\begin{quote}
\begin{singlespace}
\dots
\end{singlespace}
\end{quote}

makes the quote single spaced.

The example at the beginning shows the 12pt sub-style being used.  This
seems to give acceptable looking results, but it may be omitted to get
smaller print.
