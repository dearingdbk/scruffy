\medskip

Students enrolled in second year computer programming at Acadia 
University are required to format their program code according to a set of 
style guidelines. In previous years there was no C style checker freely 
available to the students. This occasionally resulted in students submitting 
improperly formatted code. The solution to this problem required that a program 
be constructed that maintained flexibility while providing enough functionality
to adequately improve the quality of code formatting, and produce a reduction 
in the number of style errors present in students submitted code. Ideally, 
the program would be used as the back end for a web page, so that students
would be able to submit their program and the web server would return either 
a confirmation that the style meets the guidelines or a list of non-conforming 
constructs. My omnibus solution to this problem combines four translator based
programs together, along with various functions of additional programs in order 
to provide a number of style checks on files submitted by students.
