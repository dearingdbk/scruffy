\chapter{Problem Description}
\label{chap:PROBLEM}

As previously stated in the introduction in \autoref{chap:INTRO}, in previous 
years there had been no C style checker freely available to the students. Which 
occasionally resulted in students submitting improperly formatted code.
It had been mentioned that on occasion students may consistently repeat the 
same style mistakes throughout the year, this could be a case of apathy or 
possibly the lack of responsive feedback. A large number of interactive 
learning and feedback studies argue that immediate feedback facilitates 
learning better than delayed feedback in applied settings.\citep{FEEDBACK}
Without a method of providing immediate corrective feedback to the students 
they may not be effectively retaining the corrective measures required to 
maintain their code as it applies to style errors.
